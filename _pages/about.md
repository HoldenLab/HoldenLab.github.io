Welcome to the Holden Lab website! 

We are interdisciplinary scientists who study bacterial cell biology and biophysics using super-resolution microscopy and other advanced imaging methods. Our primary biological focus is how bacteria remodel their cell wall, which is one of the most important targetsâ€‹ for antibiotics. 

We are based in the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/estates/news/ibrb_opening/">Interdisciplinary Biosciences Research Building</a>, in the 
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/">School of Life Sciences</a>, University of Warwick, near Coventry, UK. 


Key research themes:

- Mechanistic principles of bacterial cell wall remodelling
- Single molecule & super-resolution microscopy
- Open source scientific software and hardware
